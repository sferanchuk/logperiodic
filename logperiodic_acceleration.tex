\section*{Abstract}

\textit{Background.} Level of Sun irradiation continously changes at any scale of time; some features of self-affinity are anyway expected there. ''Ideal'' self-affinity imply a presence of a linear dependence between a scale of fluctuations and a scale of time; a slope of that line is a value of ''fractal dimension''. The ''scale-vs.-scale'' distributions for the fluctuations of Sun irradiation are not linear, a slope of the fitting line depends on time and a diapason of scales. 

Chaotic processes like the burning of Sun are anyway characterized, also, by a presence of some slow-scale oscillations and sudden outbreaks. A property of log-periodicity is another side of ''fractal''-like distributions, it can be applied to describe these oscillations, and it imply either inceasing or decreasing of their periodicity. Increased periodicity of chaotic outbreaks can warn about the approaching ''crash'', a ''phase transition'', a loss of any stability in an observed ''world''.

\textit{Methods.}  A presence of log-periodic oscillations would influence a scale of time, and relative positions of sequential measurements along the axis of time.
A scale distributions of Sun irradiation were compared for a couple of data sources, a presence of log-periodicity was approached trying to guess a best fit of the linear dependency for data points with modified time-axis positions. The approach was comparatively applied to fluctuations of water temperature in Baikal, were a crisis happened in around 2014. 

\textit{Results.} In early period before the crisis in Baikal, between 2010 and 2012, the scale diastribution for water temperature within a range from hours to several days looks different than in later another periods, and the attempts to apply the law of log-periodicity to this distribution appear to be ... . The same ... for the fluctuations of MgII Sun irradiation between 1978 and 2004.

\section*{Introduction}

The burning of Sun attracts attention of many physicists, and modern techniques of measurements are able to supply experimental data of various types. From the variety of approaches, two time series of measurements are shown in figure 1. Long-time observations are able to detect a presence of ''solar cycles'', regular changes of the burning intensity, 14-years cycle contributed the most to the variations of the intensity, as it can be seen in fig 1A. In the periods of instability, the burning of Sun is more ...

The two approches are ... to measure the scale of fluctuations depending on a scale of time; first is known as ''Higuchi'' dimension [1], second was proposed by Peng et al [2] ...

The generic linkage between ''fractal'' properties and a presence of log-periodicity was observed and described ... in part in theory, in part in some applied cases... [3].

\section*{Methods}

\textit{Fitting of log-periodicity}

Log-periodic perturbation $f$ depends on a time $t$ by a definition as written below: 

$t < t_c, f \sim \sin( \omega \log( t_c - t ) )$

$t > t_c, f \sim \sin( \omega \log( t - t_c ) )$

There, a critical time $t_c$ and a frequency of transformed oscillations $\omega$ are a minimal set of parameters for any log-periodicity. Peaks of this distribution which can be ... to outbreaks in an observed ''world'' are located at positions defined by expression $ 2 \pi i =  \omega \log( t_c - t_i ), i = 1, 2,  ..., n, ... $ (for a case $t < t_c$).

Let the observed distribution is in bounds between $n_m$ and $n_M$ of the assumend log-periodicity, that is, $\omega \log( t_{max} - t_c )  = n_m, \omega \log( t_{min} - t_c ) = n_M$, or \textit{vice versa}. The period $\omega$ would be then $\omega = \log( n_M ) - \log( n_m ) $, transformation of time axis $t \to t'$ which put the position of peaks $t_i, i = 1 ... (n_M - n_m)$ into a uniform sequence can be written as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
t'_i = t_{max} - ( t_{max} - t_{min} )\frac{ 1 - e^{ - \omega i } }{ 1 - e^{ - \omega (n_M - n_m) } }, t < t_c; \nonumber\\
t'_i = t_{min} + ( t_{max} - t_{min} )\frac{ 1 - e^{ - \omega i } }{ 1 - e^{ - \omega (n_M - n_m) } }, t > t_c. \\
\end{eqnarray}

This means, near the critical time the time go faster, the ''true'' time periods are wider than it was measured, and in another side of obervation period it should instead be shorter, ... to keep an overall match to a given time scale.

That is, the measure of fractal dimension is consistent for mulitiple data sources. And, the interval $s < 10$ is most sensitive (in fig 5 A) to a change of time period.

%\section*{Conclusions}

%The crisis on Baikal which began at around 2014 was possible to detect by slightly unusual variations of water temperature in two to four years before (fig 6 A). 

%If a covid-19 is not an ordinary virus pandemy, to what extent is this extraaordiunarity expanded? The exclusive search gave similarity of ''projection'' to a model of log-periodic acceleration between variations of temperature in Baikal before crisis, and variations of intensity of solar irradiation in past 30 years (fig. 7 B), this can point out to expectations of universe-scale crisis in a near future.
